Builds of my SDL2 games running on Funkey / RG-Nano

## Installing
In general on the Funkey / RG-Nano, enable usb disk mode and connect your Funkey / RG-Nano to your pc.
On the drive that appears from it there should be an `Native Games` folder, extract the zips you download from the 
[Release Section](https://github.com/joyrider3774/funkey_sdl2_games/releases) in this folder.
For example if you open `checkers - Funkey-s.zip` there will be an opk file inside, in this example named
`checkers.opk` you need to copy that file to the `Native Games` folder of your Funkey / RG-Nano disk.
